# Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:
# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird


# Here is the code :

n = int(input())
if (n % 2) != 0:
    print("Weird")
elif (n % 2) == 0:
    if 6 > n > 1:
        print("Not Weird")
    elif 5 < n < 21:
        print("Weird")
    elif n > 20:
        print("Not Weird")
